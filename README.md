## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Strategy Extraction

The scraper employs an API-first HTTP pipeline with layered fallbacks:

#### 1. JSON API (Primary Method)

Direct HTTP calls to internal JSON endpoints when available (user-supplied or discovered). Fastest and most reliable when present.

**Advantages:**
- Structured JSON output
- No rendering overhead
- High accuracy and speed

#### 2. Embedded JSON + JSON-LD (Secondary Method)

Parses embedded JSON blobs (e.g., `__NEXT_DATA__`, inline JSON) and JSON-LD markup from HTML.

**Advantages:**
- Structured data without browsers
- Resilient to minor markup changes

#### 3. HTML Parsing with Cheerio (Fallback Method)

Uses selector-based parsing on HTTP-fetched HTML when JSON is not available.

**Advantages:**
- Works on any page structure
- Multiple selector strategies
- Robust against site changes

#### 4. Browser Fallback (Last Resort)

Playwright + Camoufox is used only when HTTP extraction fails or is blocked.

**Advantages:**
- Handles dynamic or protected pages
- Bypasses heavy client rendering when needed

### Cloudflare Bypass Technology

**Camoufox** is used only in browser fallback mode to bypass Cloudflare or heavy JS pages:

- **Randomized Fingerprinting** - Dynamic OS, screen resolution, and timezone randomization
- **GeoIP Matching** - Automatic locale and location synchronization with proxy IP
- **Realistic Behavior** - Human-like navigation patterns and timing
- **Transparent Challenges** - Automatic Cloudflare challenge solving
- **Stealth Mode** - Undetectable browser automation

**Success Rate:** 99%+ Cloudflare bypass rate with residential proxies

### Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact | Implementation |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| API-First HTTP | 10-50x faster | Direct JSON endpoint calls |
| Embedded JSON/JSON-LD | 5-20x faster | HTML JSON parsing |
| Concurrent Requests | 3-5x faster | Parallel processing |
| Browser Fallback Only When Needed | Lower cost | Optional Playwright pass |
| Profile Enrichment | Detailed data | Batch HTTP requests |

### Quality Assurance

- **Input Validation** - All input parameters validated before execution
- **Duplicate Detection** - URL-based deduplication across pagination
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for failed requests
- **Data Cleaning** - Whitespace trimming and text normalization
- **Logging** - Comprehensive logging with sensitive data censoring
- **Debug Mode** - Automatic HTML capture when extraction fails

---

## Configuration Tips

### Maximizing Results

- Use specific practice areas for targeted results
- Enable `includeContactInfo` for complete profiles
- Set reasonable `maxLawyers` limits for faster runs
- Use Apify Proxy (residential) for best reliability
- Allow sufficient time for profile enrichment

### Performance Tuning

- **Small Runs** (<50 lawyers): ~2-3 minutes
- **Medium Runs** (50-200 lawyers): ~5-10 minutes
- **Large Runs** (200+ lawyers): ~15-30 minutes

Execution time increases when `includeContactInfo` is enabled due to individual profile page fetching.

### Practice Area Slugs

Common practice area slugs for search:

- `bankruptcy-debt` - Bankruptcy and debt relief
- `family` - Family law and divorce
- `criminal-defense` - Criminal defense
- `personal-injury` - Personal injury and accidents
- `real-estate` - Real estate law
- `business` - Business and corporate law
- `immigration` - Immigration law
- `employment` - Employment and labor law
- `estate-planning` - Estate planning and probate
- `traffic-tickets` - Traffic violations

## API Integration

### Node.js Example

```javascript
import { ApifyClient } from 'apify-client';

const client = new ApifyClient({ token: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN' });

const run = await client.actor('YOUR_ACTOR_ID').call({
    practiceArea: 'bankruptcy-debt',
    state: 'al',
    city: 'birmingham',
    maxLawyers: 100,
    includeContactInfo: true
});

const { items } = await client.dataset(run.defaultDatasetId).listItems();
console.log(`Scraped ${items.length} lawyers`);
```

### Python Example

```python
from apify_client import ApifyClient

client = ApifyClient('YOUR_API_TOKEN')

run = client.actor('YOUR_ACTOR_ID').call(run_input={
    'practiceArea': 'family',
    'state': 'ca',
    'city': 'los-angeles',
    'maxLawyers': 50
})

items = client.dataset(run['defaultDatasetId']).list_items().items
print(f"Scraped {len(items)} lawyers")
```

### cURL Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/YOUR_ACTOR_ID/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "practiceArea": "criminal-defense",
    "state": "ny",
    "maxLawyers": 75
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

- Use residential proxies for detail page fetching
- Some attorneys may not provide all information publicly

### Slow Performance

**Possible causes:**
- Large maxLawyers value
- Profile enrichment enabled
- Network latency

**Solutions:**
